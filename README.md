High Quality Facial Recognition System
High Quality automatic face recognition System may be a web base application. 
A top quality face recognition System could be a technology capable of identifying or verifying an individual from a digital image or a video frame from a video source.
There are multiple methods within which bio-metric authentication system work, but normally, they work by comparing selected facial expression from given image with faces within a database.
it's also described a Bio-metric AI based application that may uniquely identify someone by analyzing patterns supported the personâ€™s facial, texture and shape.
We are using some different features also in our project. Example. Eyes or lips, some people have eyes in different shape or some people have little different, also the lips and nose are different. 
Means distance between nose and lips are difference off every one. So such features we use. Then in our project two phases are there the primary one is implementation of detection and second is recognition. 
Face Recognition has become a pretty field in Computer based application developed within the previous few decades. This can be thanks to the big selection of areas during which it's used.
Additionally, due to the wide several of faces, face recognition from database images, real data, capture Images.
